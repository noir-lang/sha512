Library that implements SHA512 and SHA384

## Noir version compatibility

This library is tested against all stable versions of noir from 1.0.0-beta.5.

## Benchmarks

Benchmarks are ignored by `git` and checked on pull-request. As such, benchmarks may be generated
with the following command.

```bash
# execute the following
nargo export
./scripts/build-gates-report.sh
./scripts/build-brillig-report.sh
```

The benchmark will be generated at `./benchmark-opcodes.json`, `./benchmark-circuit.json` and `./benchmark-brillig.json`.
